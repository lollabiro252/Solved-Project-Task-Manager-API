# Student Debugging Project

## Purpose

This project is **for students only**.
It is designed to help you **practice backend debugging**, not to build new features.

The code contains **intentional bugs**.



##  What You Need To Do

1. Run the project
2. Test the APIs using Postman
3. Read the errors carefully
4. Debug the existing code
5. Fix the bugs step by step
6. Add comments explaining each fix



## Rules

*  Do not rewrite the project

* Do not delete code and start over

* Do not copy solutions

* Fix the current code

* Understand every fix you make

* Comment your changes



## Important

This project **will not work correctly at first**.
That is expected.

If everything works without changes, **you missed something**.



## Reminder

Debugging is a **core backend skill**.
Take your time, think, and debug.



Good luck
